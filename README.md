## Flutter App MVVM Architecture Starter Pack
My go to framework when starting  a new flutter application

### About this framework
This framework is setuped with the stack package which makes use of the `Provider` state management solution and `flutter_hooks` under the hood.

#### Major features includes
- Auto generated routes and dynamic routing(you'll be able to navigate from your view models without the need for `context`.
- Reactive support for easier data binding
- uses `flutter_hooks` thus boiler plate code from create a stateful widget can be elimated
- Support partial widget rebuild(you don't have to unneccessarily rebuild your widget tree all the time)
